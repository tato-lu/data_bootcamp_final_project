In particular, I have:
Clearly acknowledged the work and efforts of others when submitting written work as our own. The incorporation of the work of others–including but not limited to their ideas, data, creative

Project Description
It's well-known that it's difficult for startups and small businesses to survive. In 2018, there were 30.2 million small businesses operating in the U.S. It's estimated that only 2 in 5 of those businesses are profitable, while the others breakeven or even lose money. Experts and investors look to a variety of factors to try and predict the outcome of a startup, ranging from the founder's gender to the influence of venture capitalists.

In this project, we look at about 50,000 companies listed on Crunchbase to examine the effect of funding on startup outcome and try to predict the probability that a startup is acquired (or still operating).
